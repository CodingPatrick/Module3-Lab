Persona Explanation

In my implementation of my new grocery store, I used the Wizard Navigational Pattern. This Navigational Pattern is used to 
separate tasks into a linear sequence of subtasks. I chose the option to move back and forth to give the users more freedom, while
still being held to the order of the sequence. This choice of Navigational Pattern is important because of my Personas.

In my cart I added a delivery or pick-up option. This is because both my personas use online grocery shopping for one of these two reasons.

My first Persona is named Marcus. He is a construction worker, the father of a young girl and the husband of a pregnant wife. 
He does not like online shopping. He does not have much technological experience. He enjoys using the Metro website because the Wizard
Pattern guides him through the steps it takes to order his groceries. He likes to use the curb-side pick-up option because he does 
not want to have any unnecessary interactions with others. This is in order to protect his wife and children from Covid-19.

My second Persona is named Alyssa. She is a full-time university student. She lives on campus, away from her family. She loves online
shopping, but she doesn't like spending time with groceries. She chooses the Metro site because the Wizard pattern guides her quickly
and efficiently to her goal. She does not have any grocery stores near her appartment on campus. Since she does not want to take the bus 
with many bags, she likes Metro wesbite because she can choose the delivery option. Now she can focus on studying and not waste any time
at the store.
